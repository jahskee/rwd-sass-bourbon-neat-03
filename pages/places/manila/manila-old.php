                    Manila Bay is a world-famous port; it has been the site of many naval confrontations in the 1800s by
                    Americans and Spanish. The harbor was once a strategic maritime location. It is now considered a
                    historic landmark. Strategically located in the capital city of the Philippines, Manila Bay
                    encouraged business and exchange between the Philippines and its neighboring countries, turning on
                    the door for the financial institution and trades even before Spanish occupation. With a quite
                    significant amount of land area and a long coastline, Manila Bay is located west of Luzon and is
                    directly accessible from Cavite and Metro Manila on the east, Bulacan and Pampanga are located on
                    the north, and Bataan on the northwest. Manila Bay regularly drains a significant amount of water

                    Intramuros was once the center of Spanish political, religious, and military influence in the region. It
                    can resist attacks from canons, well built by Spanish military builders. The walled structure
                    suffered grievously during the World War II; The San Agustin Church was the only structure that
                    survived the war. Designed along Spanish lines in Manila. It has five side chapels, finely carved
                    with hardwood pews dating back to the 17th hundred, 18th-century made structures are well preserved
                    to reminisce the history. Beside the chapel is an excellent museum featuring Spanish-era artifacts
                    and Spanish vest that were dated from the 1500s. It also displays some religious artworks. San
                    Agustin Church, Intramuros is famous and prominent among the structures; It was promoted as one of
                    the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1993.
